      <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
      <p>
        We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians and Owners of Country
        throughout Australia and their connection to land, sea and community.
        This research was developed on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri
        peoples who are the Traditional Custodians of the ACT region. We
        respectfully acknowledge the wisdom, guidance and openness of all
        Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples who have contributed to
        our work and we pay our respects to Elders past and present. We
        acknowledge that sovereignty has never been ceded and that Australia
        always was, and always will be, Aboriginal land.

        We dedicate this project to the deep cultural heritage and contributions
        of Chinese communities in shaping the diverse tapestry of modern
        Australia.

        We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our lecturer,
        Fiannuala Morgan, for her unwavering support and guidance throughout the
        project. Her expertise and commitment were essential in our journey to
        navigate the tools and theories in Digital Humanities.

        We would also like to thank Trove which has been a valuable resource in
        providing rich and relevant data for our project.
