    title: 'This is the longest recipe in this book',
    content: `The British Ministry of Food has called the cook books of the world to bring tasty and economical re- cipes to the British housewife, and her Australian sister now coping with rationing will also find them of great value. Try this interesting recipe: CHOP SUEY (Tsap Sui, Chinese origin) : 1/2 lb meat (any kind of meat will do pork, beef, mutton, or chic- ken), 1lb carrots, 1lb cabbage, and any other kind of vegetable such as spinach, celery, cauliflower, lettuce, or a handful of salted runner-beans previously soaked in water for 24 hours. A small onion or a shallot or a leek would naturally be a dis- tinct improvement, though not really essential. First cut up the meat into small cubes or dice, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. While the meat is absorbing the seasoning cut up the vegetables also into small pieces. Whatever amount of onions or leeks that can be spared should also be cut up and fried with a little cooking fat, margarine, or dripping. Now add the meat, and fry until well browned all over. Add the vegetables a little at a time (root vegetables are always added before green vegetables, since they take longer to cook). When all the vege- tables are in the saucepan put the lid on and leave them to cook in their own juices for a short while. In the meantime make a gravy mix- ture by mixing a tablespoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, pepper to taste, and a half a teaspoonful of sugar -if you can spare it-and 2 tablespoonfuls cold water. Stir the contents in the saucepan, and when the ingredients seem well shrunken in amount add the gravy mixture. A few drops of Worcester sauce would be an improvement to the gravy, and would take the place of the Soya bean sauce, so much used in China. Stir the gravy in well, cover the saucepan, and let it sim- mer gently for 10 minutes. It should then be ready to serve.'`,
