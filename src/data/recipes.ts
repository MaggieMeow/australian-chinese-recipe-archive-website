      "I do not know whether it was from the Chinese we got the recipe for preserving eggs in lime, but it is a fact that they preserve eggs in a solution of wood ashes, lime, and salt, mixed with water in which some aromatic plant has been boiled. This paste is run into a wooden tub, and the eggs taken fresh from the nests are embedded in it in layers. Then the tub is hermetically sealed, and at the end of six weeks the eggs are considered fit for use, but at the end of forty years they arc considered better. For every day use, eggs are steeped in salt water mixed with soot or red clay, in which they arc baked when required. A plain lightly boiled egg is never seen in China, they are always hard boiled, and the older they are the better. In one part of the country the greatest delicacy is unhatched duck roasted. The eggs are taken from the hatching-house twelve hours before hatching, placed in a hot oven and baked, then they are sold from door to door. Strange to say, the blacks of this country also follow this custom. I have known them watch a nest of wild duck eggs for days and days till ready. A correspondent asks the quantity of lime to use for preserving eggs. Take one pint of lime to each gallon of water, stir, and boil fifteen minutes. Let stand till clear and pour off the water, boil up the lime again with half the previous quantity of water, and when clear add to thc first lot. Put the eggs in be- fore they are six hours old. The above is the recipe I have used for years.",
